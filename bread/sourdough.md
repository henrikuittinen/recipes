# Sourdough

This is me documenting the actual amounts, temperature and times I use to make this bread. YMMV.

## Dough
- 280g of room temperature water (22-27°C)
- 280g ripe sourdough starter
- 250g of [bread flour](https://www.myllynparas.fi/tuotteet/emannan-puolikarkea-vehnajauho-2-kg) (~13% of protein)
- 100g of [Tipo 00 flour](https://www.molinorossetto.com/en/maxi-pack/1790-farina-tipo-00.html) with ~10% of protein.
- 50g of [whole wheat flour](https://myllarin.fi/tuote/myllarin-luomu-taysjyvavehnajauho-1-kg/)
- 10g of salt

Reserve around 30 grams of the water for wetting your hand while mixing. Hydration level is important and makes all the difference when handling the dough!

## Starter
The starter should be well fed, and on it's maximum peak when adding it to the dough. Time your starter feeding accordingly. At the time of the writing my starter is still relatively weak and the larger amount is to compensate that.

## Autolysis

1-2 hours before the starter is ready mix in the flour and the water in a bowl. Mix first by spoon and then by hand for 1-2 minutes. 
Do not overmix or knead.

Cover the bowl with a lid or plastic wrap after mixing and set in a warm place (~27°C) until the starter is ready.

## Add starter

Pour the starter into the autolysed dough, first press in the starter with fingers and then continue with a set of slap-and-folds (in the bowl is fine).

## Bulk ferment

Cover the bowl with a lid or plastic wrap after mixing and set in a warm place (~27°C).

After 30 minutes add salt and do a set of slap-and-folds (in a bowl is fine). Set to wait for an hour.

First do 3 folds in every 15 minutes and then another 3 folds in every 30 minutes.

After the last folding set to bulk ferment for another hour. 

## Shaping

After bulk ferment, set the dough on a work surfare with some flour on it. Fold the edges of the dough towards the center, then do a criss-cross shoelace pattern also from the edges of the dough. After that flip the dough the seam-side down and round the dough well. After that set in the proofing basket seam-size up.

## Proofing

Proof in a cold (~2°C) fridge for at least 3 hours.

## Baking

Bake in a dutch oven for 20 minutes in 250°C and then remove the lid, turn down the heat (230°C) and keep baking for 15-20 minutes more to get nice brown crust.
