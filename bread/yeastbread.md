# Yeast bread

This is me documenting the actual amounts, temperature and times I use to make this bread. YMMV.

## Poolish
- 150g room temp water
- 1 ml of [dry yeast](https://sunnuntai.fi/tuotteet/sunnuntai-kuivahiiva)
- 150g [Tipo 00 flour](https://www.molinorossetto.com/en/maxi-pack/1790-farina-tipo-00.html) with ~10% of protein.

Set in a glass container with a loose lid in a warm place (~27°C) for around 7-12 hours.

## Dough
- 230g of room temperature water
- All of the poolish
- 6g of dry yeast
- 250g of [bread flour](https://www.myllynparas.fi/tuotteet/emannan-puolikarkea-vehnajauho-2-kg) (~13% of protein)
- 100g of [Tipo 00 flour](https://www.molinorossetto.com/en/maxi-pack/1790-farina-tipo-00.html) with ~10% of protein.
- 50g of [whole wheat flour](https://myllarin.fi/tuote/myllarin-luomu-taysjyvavehnajauho-1-kg/)
- 10g of salt

Reserve around 30 grams of the water for wetting your hand while mixing. Hydration level is important and makes all the difference when handling the dough!

Stir the poolish and the yeast into the water, mix well in a [good sized bowl](https://www.ikea.com/fi/fi/p/blanda-blank-tarjoilukulho-ruostumaton-teraes-50057254/). Then add rest of the ingredients. Mix first by spoon and then by hand for 1-2 minutes. 
Do not overmix or knead.

## Bulk ferment

Cover the bowl with a lid or plastic wrap after mixing and set in a warm place (~27°C).

After 30 minutes do a first set of folding. Set to wait for another 30 minutes and then do another fold. 

After the last folding set to bulk ferment in a warm place (~27°C) for 1 hour. Also, remember to keep the dough in a warm place between folds.

## Shaping

After bulk ferment, set the dough on a work surfare with some flour on it. Fold the edges of the dough towards the center, then do a criss-cross shoelace pattern also from the edges of the dough. After that flip the dough the seam-side down and round the dough well. After that set in the proofing basket seam-size up.

## Proofing

Proof in a warm place for 40-50 minutes or in fridge (inside plastic bag) for 8 hours

## Baking

Bake in a dutch oven for 20 minutes in 260°C and then remove the lid, turn down the heat (230°C) and keep baking for 15-20 minutes more to get nice brown crust.
