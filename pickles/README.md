# Pickle Brine

- 1.5 liters of water
- 0.75 liters of white vinegar (10%)
- 2 dl of sugar
- 80 g salt

Combine everything, bring to boil and let simmer for 15 minutes. Add a few jamaica peppers and other aromatics of your liking.

> Note: vinegar acidity is important! Make sure you're using 10% acidity. You can also convert the amount relative to the acidity, ie. if you have 5% vinegar, just add double the amount.
