# Pickle Brine

- 1.6 liters of water
- 4 dl of apple cider vinegar (6%)
- 1.5 dl of sugar
- 1 dl of salt
- Seasoning

Combine everything, bring to boil and let simmer for 15 minutes. Add a few jamaica peppers and other aromatics of your liking.

If you're pickling jalapeÃ±os or habaneros, boil them in the brine for 2 minutes.

> Note: vinegar acidity is important! Make sure you're using 6% acidity. You can also convert the amount relative to the acidity, ie. if you have 10% vinegar, just add a bit over half of the amount.
